		faster‚Äîembodying the tagline: <strong>iterate daily. ship fast</strong>.

	<h3>How this blog works</h3>
	<p>
		All posts are written in <strong>Obsidian</strong> (my PKMS), automatically synced to this
		Astro-powered static site, and deployed to my Unraid server. The workflow itself embodies
		the tagline: iterate daily, ship fast.
	</p>
	<p>
		It's a hybrid local/remote setup that lets me write anywhere, anytime, and publish with a
		simple build command. The entire workflow is documented in this blog‚Äîmeta content about
		building the blog you're reading right now.
