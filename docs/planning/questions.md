# LLM Workflow Ideas

- [] I enjoy using gemini and claude.
* Is there a way I can expand the usage of gemini in my obsidian blog publishing workflow? So I can search, iterate on ideas quickly using llm's, have it assist in the writing, ect..?
* Should I just use vscode and run gemini cli in there or claude code?

**Ideas for LLM integration:**
- Obsidian plugins: Text Generator (OpenAI/Claude), Copilot, Smart Connections
- VSCode + Claude Code for editing markdown (current environment)
- Gemini CLI for quick research/ideation
- Astro content collections could be enhanced with LLM-generated summaries
- Consider a pre-build script that uses LLM to generate meta descriptions, tags, etc.
